                    My name is Philip and I'm 17. I was born and currently live in Sydney NSW. My mother's side of the family originally comes from Italy and 
                    my father's side comes from Germany. I only speak English but learning another language is something that I keep in the back of my mind 
                    because it is something that has interested me, ideally Italian and or Japanese. My highest education to date is year 10 of high school 
                    which I completed in 2020, I've also completed a web design course on freecodecamp.org. I've been an avid gamer since I was six with my 
                    first gaming console being the Nintendo Wii. Today I mainly play multiplayer games because I enjoy being able to interact while gaming with
                    others.

                <p class="content-text">
                    What is your interest in IT?<br>
                    <br>
                    My interest in IT is all about creating. I love being able to make interesting things that I set my mind to with programming alone. 
                    When I first tried out programming by watching an old YouTube video on creating a calculator with Batch, I kept recreating that same 
                    calculator over and over while marvelling at how the code I wrote on notepad brought the console window where I could do simple 
                    calculations to life. Over time I dipped my toes into different areas such as game and web development, trying to see what interested me. 
                    I am still quite interested in game programming and want to see where that interest takes me. Operating system programming has also been
                    on my mind for some time and it is something I want to eventually try out when I have the skills to do so.
                </p>

                <p class="content-text">
                    When did you interest in IT start?<br>
                    <br>
                    I started becoming interested in IT when I was in primary school. We had multiple devices at home that I loved using such as our Foxtel
                    tv that allowed me to watch my favourite cartoons, my collection of video game consoles that I would use obssesively and the one slow 
                    laptop my mum owned that she let me use to play Minecraft. With all this technology I was naturally interested in IT and it was in year
                    5 that I learned about what programming was. This started my journey into learning about IT in small parts over time, slowly gathering 
                    knowledge until I decided I wanted to pursue an IT career.
                </p>

                <p class="content-text">
                    Was there a particular event or person that sparked your interest?<br>
                    <br>
                    One event that cemented my interest in IT was when my father and I were watching a movie named Chappie, released in 2013 the movie follows
                    a robot created by a genius programmer that gave Chappie true artificial intelligence beyond even the smartest human. While I enjoyed the 
                    movie, the part that stuck with me was the technical portions involving programming and the creation of Chappie. I found it so incredible, 
                    the fact that you could create machines like the ones shown in the movie with programming. Of course after the movie I was filled to the 
                    brim with questions which my dad had no answers to but encouraged me to learn about online.
                </p>

                <p class="content-text">
                    Why did you choose to come to RMIT?<br>
                    <br>
                    The reason I chose to come to RMIT is because it was the best university for my area of interest. I always struggled getting through school
                    due to my autism. This struggle led to me to leave after completing year 10. I still wanted to go to university but without an ATAR I needed
                    a pathway to do my studies. I went through OUA's services to help me find such a pathway and they recommended RMIT. Originally I was going
                    to transfer to another university that the rest of my family went to for their studies but I quickly realized I'd much rather stay at RMIT.
                    I'm really enjoying my time studying here so I definitely plan on doing the rest of my studies here as well.
                </p>

                <p class="content-text">
                    What do you expect to learn during your studies?<br>
                    <br>
                    During this course I expect to gain an understanding of the IT industry. I want to learn how to use different tools and technologies that 
                    allow me to efficiently program in a team like applications that allow us to communicate or tools like github that keep our work clean and 
                    combined. My weakest skill in IT is the ability to work in groups and the ability to socialize comfortably. That is why I look forward to 
                    having group experiences and learning the best way to operate as a team in this course. I also expect to have a more concrete idea about what 
                    field of IT I want to pursue by the time I have completed this course.

                            In this role you work as a Linux Software Developer. Your job is to help create and maintain Linux for IBM's Power Processors used in servers
                            and or super computers. On top of developing the Linux kernel you will also work on FOSS applications and libraries, improving their security
                            and performance to provide support for the upcoming changes in IBM's power architecture. What makes this position appealing to me is that it
                            revolves around operating system development with the Linux kernel and development of FOSS applications.

                    Current Skills<br>
                    <br>
                    Right now my skills are very limited. I have very little experience with general programming languages such as C# or Javascript. I know the very
                    basics of Git and Bash but I am nowhere near proficient with either. My Linux knowledge is next to nothing as I have not used it before, alongside
                    that I have no knowledge of how to program in C or basic scripting languages such as Python. I do have proficiency in making html css websites but
                    unfortunately those skills do not provide anything of value for this job.
                </p>

                <p class="content-text">
                    How I Will Get These Skills<br>
                    <br> 
                    My plan to obtain these skills is to first learn general IT and basic git skills through this course. After I have completed that I am doing the 
                    course, Introduction to Programming which teaches Python. This is helpful not just for the skills I will obtain in Python but programming in general.
                    Knowing how to program in any language makes it easier to learn others as it is mostly just learning syntax as opposed to learning fundamental
                    programming concepts for the first time. Some time during my learning of Python I plan on learning how to use Bash on a Linux or Unix operating 
                    system as skills go well with skills in Python or any programming language.<br>
                    <br>
                    The next big step is to start learning C. While the programming concepts I learned in Python will be helpful with C there is one thing that Python 
                    doesn't teach that I will have to learn here, memory management. Python has a feature called Garbage Collecting meaning you don't have to worry about
                    allocating memory while programming where as C makes you do it yourself leading to a steeper learning curve as opposed to other languages. Working
                    on a FOSS application is something that I think will happen naturally as opposed to learning about it at a set step after or another. It would also 
                    go hand in hand when getting familiar with the Linux kernel and gaining experience in it's community.

                    What do the results of these tests mean for you?<br>
                    <br>
                    The results of these tests are very interesting to read and they allow me to gain a better understanding of who I am. The majority of the results are shockingly similar 
                    to how I actually behave and think which speaks to their accuracy. My strengths and weaknesses are also accurately depicted in the personality tests and reading through 
                    the content reinforces my knowledge of what I need to work on in my life. In the learning styles test my preferred learning style is visual. This holds up as throughout 
                    my life I've always learned best through visual information. With this information I know I can optimize my learning through a primary use of visuals with supporting 
                    secondary learning styles.

                <p class="content-text">
                    How will these results affect your behaviour in a team?<br>
                    <br>
                    My behavior in a team environment is primarily influenced by my lack of social skills. They have been my weak point for a long time and usually limit my abilities and 
                    value when required to interact or work with others. Being able to work effectively in a team is a priority so that I can thrive in a team instead of struggling. With 
                    that said I am able to provide value in a team with my problem solving skills and I think I would do well in an environment where I can focus on working more then on 
                    interacting.

                <p class="content-text">
                    How should you take this into account when forming a team?<br>
                    <br>
                    When forming a team I should prioritize being comfortable conversing with and being around my team mates to remove some of the awkwardness that may negatively impact 
                    my ability to contribute meaningfully in my work. In terms of allocating roles when creating teams I am much more confident in a non leadership role. My work is best 
                    when I can focus on work that doesn't involve other people as opposed to a leaders work involving duties like allocating people team roles based on their abilities 
                    and interests which I would have to learn through conversation and questions.

                    Overview<br>
                    <br>
                    My project idea is to create an application for calorie counting on Windows 10 with hopes to bring it to other platforms, notably IOS and Android. Easy Counter
                    is a calorie counter built around being customizable for the user while also keeping things simple. I find that with most calorie counters I have used there are
                    lots of confusing features and bad UI's that can make them intimidating. With Easy Counter I want to fix this by keeping things simple in the UI department 
                    while also giving it the features I have noticed are missing in the calorie counters I rely on to track my eating.<br>
                    <br>
                </p>

                <p class="content-text">
                    Description<br>
                    <br>
                    My product will be a Windows 10 desktop application named Easy Counter that allows you to count the calories of the foods and drinks you consume. Easy Counter 
                    will have all the features I consider to be at the center of any calorie counter along side all the ones I personally feel are necessary to make using Easy 
                    Counter a good user-friendly experience.<br>
                    <br>
                    To start off with I want Easy Counter to have a UI with separate tabs for distinctly different sets of information and functionality so that the UI doesn't 
                    get muddled up with separate parts of the app on the same screen. The main tab will contain your daily caloric information represented with a large visual in 
                    the center of the screen. Alongside the daily calories visual will be buttons to access separate meal windows that you can add yourself to give order to your 
                    meals and snacks. In each of these sections you can add foods from a large list that comes with the app or you can add your own custom foods and enter the 
                    caloric or kilo joules value of that food per 100 grams.<br>
                    <br>
                    One of the quality-of-life features that Easy Counter will have is being able to choose between kilo joules or calories and adding your own foods work in 
                    tandem with this. Most foods list their nutritional value in kilo joules and on Easy Counter you can enter that value off the product with the conversion 
                    between kilo joules to calories happening in the background so that you don't have to worry about doing it yourself. Not only can you add your own foods but 
                    also recipes or meals consisting of separate foods so that you can log your own home cooking.<br>
                    <br>
                    One of the big problems I find calorie counters have is that they can become quite limited with restaurant foods especially when that restaurant doesn't list 
                    their foods nutritional information. Easy Counter will have foods that are the average of multiple different restaurants same food like fries. Foods from 
                    restaurants that do list their nutritional value will be separate because those will be more accurate for that individual food. Another handy function I have 
                    always desired in calorie counters is in relation to customizing orders from restaurants. If you get a cheeseburger with extra cheese and without tomato you 
                    will be able to do that in the app while still tracking an accurate nutritional value of the food.<br>
                    <br>
                    The second tab of Easy Counter will be where you can customize your settings, preferences and information. The preferences section of this tab will be where you 
                    choose your app theme and choice of nutrition value those being calories or kilo joules. There may be more preferences necessary but for now those are the only 
                    that I think are important. The information surrounding the users actual weight loss are managed in this section. This information such as weight, weight goal and 
                    calorie budget not only help the app function but act as a way for the user to keep track of things like their own weight loss overtime. I plan to add more functionality, 
                    features and to make Easy Counter more complex over time but for now I see tools detailed in this description to be the most important in the first release version to be 
                    immediately valuable and usable.

                    Tools and Technologies<br>
                    <br>
                    I will use Python as the primary tool in creating my application. Git and Github will be used for managing source control as well as a way to download the finished product. 
                    Since Easy Counter is a GUI app I chose to use a Python library named Tkinter since it was designed specifically for GUI apps and is great for beginners due to it's simplicity. 
                    With a GUI app comes the need for graphics and UI elements which I will create myself using Krita, a free and open source art application which I know I can rely on since it 
                    has served me countless times in the past. The website to go with the project will be made of static HTML CSS with hosting on Github Pages.

                    Skills Required<br>
                    <br>
                    The most obvious skill required is sufficient knowledge in writing Python programs. Learning this will be easy, as Python is a simple syntax scripting language with a plethora of 
                    tutorials and teachings in various formats throughout the internet. There is also the Tkinter Python library which has a larger focus on being beginner friendly then other GUI libraries. 
                    I will need basic GitHub and Git skills but I already have sufficient knowledge of both to accomplish what I need. Lastly, Krita. While most art applications have a learning curve and 
                    sometimes and intimidating amount of features I am already familiar with the apps ins and outs as I have used it for years before hand.

                    Outcome<br>
                    <br>
                    Assuming the project is successful I hope that my application makes calorie counting easier for users of calorie counter apps everywhere. Having an application that can fit a plethora 
                    of different eating situations whether that be home cooking, packaged food or restaurants in an easy to use app will remove that part of the stress of calorie counting and let you focus 
                    on your main goal. Instead of not being able to reliably count the calories on your highly customized McDonalds cheeseburger meal you will be able to edit it just as much in the app as you 
                    would at the restaurant. Having a calorie counter app that addresses all the other apps' shortcomings would encourage them to step up their game so that people don't have to dig through a 
                    large amount of calorie counters all with different features trying to settle on which one fits their needs the most.
